== Specialized Version of @Component Annotation

Spring provides some specialized version of @Component annotation along with the generic @Component annotation itself.

. @Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component or bean.
. @Repository is a stereotype for the persistence layer.
. @Service is a stereotype for the service layer.
. @Controller is a stereotype for the presentation layer.
. @RestController is a stereotype for the rest service layer.

[TIP]
====
Consider using specialized annotation instead of generic @Component annotation in appropriate scenario.
@Repository, @Service, @Controller annotations are acts almost same as @Component annotation during bean scanning and bean registration, but they have other specialization.

If @Repository annotation used in database layer then it will help to catch platform-specific exceptions and re-throw them as one of Springâ€™s unified unchecked exception.
Whereas @Component annotation doesn't have this specialization.
