====
*Convention over Configuration* means, the environment in which you are working (e.g. language, framework) assumes many logical situations by default.
So if you adapt those conventions (e.g. default source directory structure), it behaves as expected without having to configure anything (e.g. configure source directory location).
By adopting conventions rather than explicitly creating configuration every time, programming become more productive task and reduces the repetitive configuration.

If your business requirement needs to ignore default conventions, or the default behavior doesn't match with your expectation, you can still change by explicitly defining you configuration.

This concept is related to ideas like the concept of *Sensible Defaults*.
